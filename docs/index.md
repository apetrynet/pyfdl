# Welcome to PyFDL

PyFDL is a toolkit to parse and produce [Framing Decision List (FDL)](https://theasc.com/society/ascmitc/asc-framing-decision-list) files in python.  
In addition to parsing FDL files, PyFDL aims to provide sample applications/plugins to apply framing intents
described in the FDL.

PyFDL is modeled around the official FDL [spec](https://github.com/ascmitc/fdl/tree/main/Specification).
